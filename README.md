# Data Engineer Portfolio | Matthew Shedden
This portfolio contains a selection of data analysis and machine learning projects I have conducted.
## English Premier League results predictor
Exploratory data analysis is performed on EPL results, forked from *link*. The **first** objective is to transform the data into a readable format, before trends in results and determinant factors of match results are identified. **Second**, a Shallow Regressor is created to predict the correct number of goals scored based upon other match-related statistics. **Third**, a Shallow Classifier is created to predict the correct outcome of the game for each team, based upon match statistics and previous results.

## Spotify Song predictions
An end-to-end shallow ML project, where a song's score as well as its genre are predicted using a regressor and classifier, respectively.

## Tender classification based on its text
An Deep Learning project using Natural Language processing on Tender Searches for an anonymised government contract tendering organisation.
