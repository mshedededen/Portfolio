# Mini Projects (1-weekend) | Matthew Shedden
*The objective of these projects is to challenge myself, help others, and prototype ideas. I hopefully will build this out over the next year, concurrent to my day-job.*

## Budget and Investment Tracker template
The genesis of this template was one I made personally, for myself. When a friend began using it and really liked its content, I decided to publish it here.
1. Track budget by populating a ledger of transactions which is summarised on another tab.
2. Track value of investment portfolios (stocks, crypto, FX), all in one place.
