# Project overview

**Purpose**: Trial version of a project I am doing as part of my full-time job within a Scotland-based Investment Fund. The aim is to build a database comprising of tables which ingest **1)** stock data; **2)** ad-hoc investment thesis data; and **3)** ongoing company news data. Thereafter, data will be fed into a dashboard to provide an interface which allows members of the investment team to easily track performance and (if desired) updated investment theses.

1. Outline list of companies we invest in.
2. Collect financial data (using Quandl).
3. Collect quantitative data on the Investment Thesis.
4. Collect quantitative data on the Company News.
5. Create dashboard where data can be presented and select data can be edited.

Disclaimer: All data presented in this project is **unrelated** to my current employer, McInroy & Wood Ltd. Therefore, no breaches of confidentiality are met.
