# Projects | Matthew Shedden
*The objective of these projects is to challenge myself, help others, and prototype ideas. I hopefully will build this out over the next year, concurrent to my day-job.*

## Budget and Investment Tracker template

*September 2021*

The genesis of this template was one I made personally, for myself. When a friend began using it and really liked its content, I decided to publish it here.
1. Track budget by populating a ledger of transactions which is summarised on another tab.
2. Track value of investment portfolios (stocks, crypto, FX), all in one place.

## Friendly reminder demo

*January 2022*

Using a list of generated friends the user can randomise and track friends they have been keeping in contact with, and identify friends they are inadvertently losing touch with. This project was a quick one which mainly focusses on Python programming skills. View project [here](https://github.com/mshedededen/Portfolio/tree/main/Mini-projects/FriendlyReminder).

- Update: This project has been put on temporary hiatus as next stage of 'FriendlyReminder' is being conducted as part of a small group. Click to see the application here: ['Smart Contact Reminder'](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.barta.stayintouch&hl=en_GB&gl=US).

## Equity Research Dashboard

*February 2022*

The goal is to simplify internal investment analytics workflows (**Office 365 applications**) and aggregate these with external data sources (**Python**, **SQL**, **uiPath**). A dashboard (**Power BI**) collates these disparate workflows and presents in one location. Project is designed with real-world practicalities in mind (I work in a small investment management firm) and to be utilised and modified by non-technically-minded persons.
